class Solution:
    def checkValidString(self, s: str) -> bool:
        """
        Checks whether the given string represents a valid string containing balanced parentheses,
        '*' characters acting as any valid parentheses (open or close), or an empty string.

        Args:
            s (str): The input string containing parentheses and '*' characters.

        Returns:
            bool: True if the input string is valid, False otherwise.

        Intuition:
        - We use two counters, left_min and left_max, to track the minimum and maximum count of open parentheses required to balance the string.
        - '*' characters are treated as placeholders that can be interpreted as either open or close parentheses, allowing flexibility in the count of open parentheses.
        - As we iterate through the string, we adjust these counters based on encountered characters.
        - If the count of open parentheses becomes negative, it indicates an invalid string.
        - At the end, if left_min is equal to 0, it means all open parentheses are balanced by corresponding close parentheses or '*' characters, making the string valid.

        Time Complexity: O(n)
        - Where n is the length of the input string s. The function iterates through each character of the string once.

        Space Complexity: O(1)
        - The function uses a constant amount of extra space, regardless of the size of the input string.
